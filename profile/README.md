# Welcome!

This GitHub organization gathers all the projects I build and maintain as a freelance developer.
It serves as a clean, organized space where I can share work with clients, host technical assets, and publish tools that I use across my projects.

## 👋 About This Space

Here, you'll find:

* **Client Projects** (private) – websites, apps, and custom solutions.
* **Reusable Modules & Utilities** – code I use to speed up development.
* **Public Resources** – small tools, examples, and open‑source contributions.

My goal is to keep everything transparent, organized, and easy to access.


## 🛠 Technologies I Work With

Depending on the project, I commonly use:

* **Frontend:** Angular, React, TypeScript, HTML/CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, PHP, Express
* **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* **Other Tools:** GitHub Actions, Docker, CI/CD workflows


## 📂 Project Access for Clients

If you're a client and need access to your project repository:

1. Send me your GitHub username.
2. I’ll grant you private access to the appropriate repository.

If you prefer not to use GitHub, I can also provide the project as a **ZIP archive**.
